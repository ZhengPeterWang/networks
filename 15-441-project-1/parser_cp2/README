Lex Yacc Starter Package
------------------------
This folder contains following files:

1) lexer.l: Lexer (Lexical analyzer) for HTTP grammar. This file
   contains the code to generate all the tokens that you will need.

2) parser.y: HTTP Parser. This is the file that you want to
   modify. Currently, it does contain some helpful rules. But, as in
   its current state, it can not parse HTTP packets. You will write
   the grammar for that. The main() function in this file opens a file
   passed to it on command line and tries to parse it according to the
   rules of grammar. Once your parser is ready, you won't need that
   main() function anymore. Instead, you will invoke yyparse() from
   your code. Please take a moment to see what main() function is
   doing.

3) http-request.txt: This file contains a sample HTTP request. Once
   you have written your parser, you can use this file to verify that
   it works correctly. (You will find hexdump command line program
   useful to see CRLFs in this file).

4) Makefile: Contains rules to compile lex and yacc files. You will
   need take a moment to think about how you can merge this into your
   Makefile.

All the best!
